Apple today released iOS 18.6.2 and iPadOS 18.6.2, more minor updates for the iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 operating systems. iOS 18.6.2 comes less than a week after the launch of iOS 18.6.1, an update that re-added blood oxygen monitoring support to the latest Apple Watch models. iOS 18.6.2 and iPadOS 18.6.2 can be downloaded on eligible devices over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Apple has also released iPadOS 17.7.10 for iPads that aren't able to run &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;. According to Apple's release notes, iOS 18.6.2 and iPadOS 18.6.2 provides important security fixes and the updates are recommended for all users. We are less than a month away from the launch of iOS 26, the next-generation version of iOS that will replace &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, so this will likely be one of the last updates to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beyond security fixes.
