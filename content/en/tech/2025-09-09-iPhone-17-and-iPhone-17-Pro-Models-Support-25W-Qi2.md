The iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max can charge at up to 25W using the next-generation Qi2.2 chargers. Qi2.2 is an upgraded specification that matches the 25W charging speed of the updated MagSafe specification introduced last year. Apple debuted &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 2 last year, and the iPhone 16 models, &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models can charge at up to 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, so now the new devices will be able to get the same charging speed with Qi2.2. Qi2.2 charging speeds require a Qi2.2 charger, and accessory makers are starting to come out with wireless charging options that support the new standard. The iPhone Air is limited to 20W charging over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; and Qi2.2, so it is not able to reach the 25W charging speeds that other models are capable of.
