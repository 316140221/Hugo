OpenAI today introduced GPT-5, which the company says brings a "significant leap" in intelligence and fewer hallucinations. GPT-5 is supposed to be better at following instructions and minimizing sycophancy. The model offers improved performance across coding, math, writing, health, visual perception, and more. OpenAI says that GPT-5 is its best coding model to date, with improvements to complex front-end generation and debugging large code repositories. Along with better coding, GPT-5 has improved writing capabilities and it is better at answering health-related questions. According to OpenAI, GPT-5 is "significantly less likely to hallucinate" compared to prior models.
