Apple today seeded the release candidate version of an upcoming macOS Sequoia 15.6 update to public beta testers and developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the third macOS Sequoia 15.6 beta. Testers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. There's no word yet on what's included in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.6, and no new features have been found in the betas so far. Apple's work on &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is winding down as it focuses on macOS Tahoe, the newest version of macOS that's coming in the fall.Related Roundup: macOS SequoiaRelated Forum: macOS SequoiaThis article, &quot;Apple Seeds Release Candidate Version of macOS Sequoia 15.6&quot; first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums
