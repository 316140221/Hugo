Taiwan's Commercial Times this week reported that Apple's Vision Pro headset will be updated next year with Apple's R2 chip. The report said the chip — along with A20 chips for iPhones, and M6 chips for Macs — will be fabricated with TSMC's latest 2nm process. The current Apple Vision Pro is equipped with Apple's M2 chip, which serves as the device's main processor, along with an R1 chip for input processing.

R1 streams new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds — 8x faster than the blink of an eye.By moving to a 2nm process — the R1 chip is likely 3nm — the R2 chip would have even better performance for input processing. According to previous rumors, the Apple Vision Pro will be updated as soon as this ye...
