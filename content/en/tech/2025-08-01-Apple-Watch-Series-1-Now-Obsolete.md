Apple now considers second-generation Apple Watch Series 1 models released in 2016 to be obsolete, according to the company's vintage and obsolete products list. Apple updated the list to move the Series 1 Apple Watch models from the vintage section to the obsolete section, as it has now been more than seven years since the devices were last offered for sale. The Series 1 models were sold alongside the Apple Watch Series 2 models, and were the successor to the original Apple Watch models. The Series 1 Apple Watch was almost identical to the original Apple Watch, but it had a faster S1P processor. Apple products are considered vintage five years after they were last distributed for sale, while a product is considered obsolete at the seven year mark.
