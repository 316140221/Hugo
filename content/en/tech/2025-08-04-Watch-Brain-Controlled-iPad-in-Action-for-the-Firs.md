For the first time, an individual has been seen publicly controlling an iPad entirely through thought, thanks to Apple's new brain-computer interface (BCI) protocol and Synchron's implantable Stentrode device. A new video from Synchron shows how Mark, a participant in the company's COMMAND clinical study and a person living with ALS, can navigate the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s Home Screen, launch apps, and compose text, all without moving his hands, speaking, or using his eyes. Mark's control of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is powered by a combination of Apple's accessibility feature "Switch Control" and the Stentrode BCI, which is implanted into a blood vessel above the brain's motor cortex. The endovascular implant captures neural signals related to motor intent and wirelessly transmits them to an external decoder. That decoder interfaces directly with iPadOS through Apple's BCI HID standard. The BCI HID protocol enables closed-loop communication between Apple devices and Synchron's technology, with...
