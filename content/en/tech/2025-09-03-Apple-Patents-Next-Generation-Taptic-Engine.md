Apple has been granted a patent for a shock-resistant haptic engine design that aims to significantly improve the durability of future iPhones, Apple Watches, and other devices.

The patent is titled "Electronic device having a shock-resistant haptic engine" and was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office earlier this week (via Patently Apple).

The design incorporates springs with varying thickness and chamfered edges, enabling them to respond softly to minor impacts while stiffening under heavy loads to absorb and distribute force more effectively. The haptic engine described in the filing consists of a movable mass suspended on flexures within an enclosure. During standard operation, this mass vibrates to produce tactile feedback, but during an impa...
