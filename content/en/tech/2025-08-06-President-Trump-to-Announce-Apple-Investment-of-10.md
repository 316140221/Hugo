President Trump will today announce that Apple will invest an additional &#36;100 billion to support manufacturing in the United States (via Bloomberg). The announcement is reportedly set to include a new manufacturing program to bring more of Apple's supply chain into the U.S. Apple has already announced &#36;500 billion for US manufacturing over the next four years, including a new server manufacturing plant in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan, and additional spending with domestic suppliers. Today's &#36;100 billion takes Apple's total commitment to &#36;600 billion. The Trump administration has had a contentious relationship with Apple, threatening 25% tariffs on the company if it didn't move iPhone manufacturing to the United States. More to follow...
