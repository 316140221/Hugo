"Nuremberg," competent and watchable as it is, isn’t big on psychological tension or insight. It’s supposed to be an irony that Göring and Kelley become "friends," or at least that they establish an intimate intellectual bond, sort of like Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. But Rami Malek, while he brings a conversational energy to the role, also brings a weird insecurity; along the way, his Kelley almost seems to forget what his job is. Crowe acts with consummate command even as Göring, by design, keeps the audience at arm’s length.
