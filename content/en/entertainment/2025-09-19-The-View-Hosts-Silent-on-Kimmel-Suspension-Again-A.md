The hosts of &#8220;The View&#8221; stayed silent for the second day in a row over their parent company ABC&#8217;s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s late-night show over his controversial Charlie Kirk comments. On Thursday&#8217;s episode of &#8220;The View,&#8221; the hosts surprisingly did not touch on Kimmel&#8217;s show being taken off the air indefinitely the night before. [&#8230;]
