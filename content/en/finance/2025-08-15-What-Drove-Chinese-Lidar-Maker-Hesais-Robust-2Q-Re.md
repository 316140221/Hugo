Hesai Group, the world’s largest maker of lidar sensors used in driver assistance systems, posted strong results in the second quarter, including a 52% jump in revenue. The company's co-founder and CEO David Li attributes strong sales volumes to China's regulatory clarification on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. He also says Hesai has been diversifying its customer portfolios and working on international partnerships, including a new deal with Toyota. Li speaks exclusively on "Bloomberg: The China Show."
