European leaders are increasingly concerned that Russia will mount a new offensive on Ukraine as they sit down with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss security guarantees for his country. Zelenskiy said on Friday that Russia had relocated 100,000 soldiers to the frontline outside the city, which the Kremlin’s forces have tried to encircle and seize without success for more than a year. In markets news, China’s financial regulators are considering a number of cooling measures for the stock market as they grow concerned about the speed of a $1.2 trillion rally since the start of August, people familiar with the matter said.
