This week, Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers says the Fed’s policy leans on the looser side, given financial conditions, skewing the balance of risks towards inflation. MIT’s Rafael Reif takes us through Massachusetts as an example of an innovation ecosystem that is developing ways to fund research as the federal government steps back. Plus, a test of Argentine President Javier Milei’s austerity measures is coming. After suffering a setback in a crucial election, the future of Milei’s vision to reform Argentina’s economy is in question. Later, Tom Brady and US investors are betting on Birmingham, not London, to fuel the UK’s next big economic growth story. (Source: Bloomberg)
