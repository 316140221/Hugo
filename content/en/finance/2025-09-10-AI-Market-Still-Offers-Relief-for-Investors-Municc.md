M&amp;G Investment Management's Maria Municchi discusses equity markets as technology shares powered gains in global stocks. "There is certainly this part of the market that is AI-focused that is continuing to be a source of good news, a source of relief for investors," she tells Bloomberg Television. Municchi also says there is a need to start being "a little bit cautious" as earnings trends and expectations for parts of the US market outside the tech space are "not actually that great."
