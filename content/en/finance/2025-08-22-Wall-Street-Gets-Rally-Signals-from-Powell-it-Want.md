Wall Street traders were waiting for a signal from Jerome Powell to keep a rally going, and they got it when the Fed chair struck a more dovish tone in a speech. The speech led to a surge in stocks and bonds, with Treasuries rallying and the S&amp;P 500 Index rebounding from a five-day slide, and futures traders started pricing in a September rate cut. Bloomberg News' Molly Smith and Eric Weiner joined Tim Stenovec and Norah Mulinda on 'Bloomberg Buisnessweek Daily' to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)
