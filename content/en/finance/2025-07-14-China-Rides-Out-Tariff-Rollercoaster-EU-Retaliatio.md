China ended the first half of the year with a record trade surplus of about $586 billion after exports to the US began to stabilize, with factories riding out the tariff rollercoaster that upended global commerce. Exports rose 5.8% in June from a year earlier to $325 billion, exceeding the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Meanwhile, the EU is preparing to step up its engagement with other countries hit by Donald Trump’s tariffs following a slew of new threats to the bloc and other US trading partners, according to people familiar with the matter. The contacts with nations including Canada and Japan could include the potential for coordination, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Today's guests: Modupe Adegbembo, Jefferies Economist, Javier Martínez-Acha Vásque, Panamanian Foreign Minister, Sumant Sinha, ReNew Chairman & CEO (Source: Bloomberg)
