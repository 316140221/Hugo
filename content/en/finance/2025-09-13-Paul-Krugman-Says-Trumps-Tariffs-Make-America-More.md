Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that tariff “chaos” and President Donald Trump's immigration policies are the real drag on growth by raising costs, freezing investment, and ultimately hitting consumers. He says a 1950s-style manufacturing revival is illusory, tariff revenue won’t fix the deficit, and U.S. trade-rule credibility has suffered lasting damage. On New York City politics, he expects only marginal policy shifts if Democratic nominee for mayor Zohran Mamdani wins. (Source: Bloomberg)
