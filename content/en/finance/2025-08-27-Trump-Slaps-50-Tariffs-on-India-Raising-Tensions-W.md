US President Donald Trump imposed a crushing 50% tariff on Indian goods to punish the country for buying Russian oil, upending a decades-long push by Washington to forge closer ties with New Delhi. The new tariffs, the highest in Asia, took effect at 12:01 a.m. in Washington on Wednesday, doubling the existing 25% duty on Indian exports. In other news, the Trump administration is reviewing options for exerting more influence over the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional banks that would potentially extend its reach beyond personnel appointments in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. It follows Trump’s move to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Today's guests: Maya Bhandari, Neuberger Berman CIO for Multi-Asset EMEA, Shumita Deveshwar, TS Lombard Chief India Economist, Alan Siow, Ninety One Emerging Markets Corporate Debt Co-Head (Source: Bloomberg)
