JPMorgan Global Research Chair Joyce Chang discusses what to expect from the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision. "I think you're going to get a 25 basis-point cut," she tells Bloomberg Television, adding that the central bank is "going to really take a look at the employment mandate" following August jobs data. "We think that you're still going to get 25 basis-points cuts at the subsequent meetings, but look at about 100 basis points in total," Chang says. (Source: Bloomberg)
