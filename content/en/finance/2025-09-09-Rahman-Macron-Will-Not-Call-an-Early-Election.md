Given that Emmanuel Macron does not want to call an early election, he has no other choice than to form a coalition with the French Socialist party says Mujtaba Rahman, Managing Director for Europe at Eurasia Group. Elsewhere in Europe, Rahman contends that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is in "real trouble" as the Labour party continues to lose popularity, whilst in Germany, there is a chance of the government collapsing next year due to fiscal concerns. Rahman spoke to Francine Lacqua on "Bloomberg: The Pulse". (Source: Bloomberg)
