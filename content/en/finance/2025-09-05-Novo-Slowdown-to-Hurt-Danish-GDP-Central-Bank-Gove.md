National Bank of Denmark Governor Christian Kettel Thomsen discusses the outlook for economic growth amid weakened sales growth at drug maker Novo Nordisk. The central bank will reduce its growth forecast "quite significantly," Kettel Thomsen says during an exclusive conversation with Bloomberg’s Sanne Wass at the bank’s headquarters in Copenhagen. Novo has become Denmark’s single most important company with its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic boosting exports, tax receipts and jobs in recent years.
