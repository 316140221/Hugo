Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person Wednesday after a jump in Oracle shares added a record amount to his fortune. Ellison’s wealth soared to $89 billion after Oracle's latest earnings results surpassed analysts’ expectations, with the company saying there’s more growth to come. That increase lifted Ellison's total net worth to $383.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It’s the biggest one-day increase ever recorded, and put him ahead of Musk for much of the day Wednesday before the Tesla CEO edged back into pole position by $1 billion. Bloomberg News Wealth Americas Team Leader Kristine Owram joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)
