President Xi Jinping used a mix of bonhomie and economic allure this week to send Donald Trump a clear message: Beijing has too much global clout to be dictated by the US. Cameras captured the Chinese leader in a rare, unscripted huddle on Monday with Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi &mdash; his most powerful partners in resisting America on the world stage &mdash; at a summit in the Chinese port city of Tianjin. At one point, Xi held the hand of his Indian counterpart, as the three men laughed casually, a striking scene given just months earlier New Delhi and Beijing were seen as rivals. The Asia Society Policy Institute Vice President Wendy Cutler joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)
