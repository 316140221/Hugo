Mitsuyuki Tominaga, President and COO at Asics, discusses the company's business strategy after it raised its full-year forecast. The sportswear maker said earnings are seen rising faster than previously expected due to strong performance in its running, sports style and Onitsuka Tiger categories and reduced uncertainty around US tariffs. He speaks with Avril Hong and Paul Allen on "Bloomberg: The Asia Trade". *Correct: Asics lowered their tariff impact expectation from 5 billion yen to 3 billion yen, not 5 trillion to 3 trillion yen.
