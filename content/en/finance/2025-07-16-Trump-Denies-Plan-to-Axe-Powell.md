President Donald Trump denied he is seeking to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after raising the idea in a closed-door meeting with congressional Republicans that leaked to the media. “No, we’re not planning on doing anything,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. He later added, “I don’t rule out anything, but I think it’s highly unlikely, unless he has to leave for fraud.” A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity earlier Wednesday, said they expected Trump to soon move against the Fed chief after his meeting with members of Congress visiting the White House to discuss cryptocurrency legislation. Some lawmakers also left that Tuesday evening meeting with that impression, and Trump acknowledged that he had polled the participants about dismissing Powell. Bloomberg's Mike McKee reports.
