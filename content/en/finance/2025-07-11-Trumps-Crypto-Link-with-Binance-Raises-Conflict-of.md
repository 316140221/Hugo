Binance has been a coder, a promoter and an early adopter for World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, people familiar with the matter say. Later, Binance’s founder and principal owner, Changpeng Zhao, said publicly that he had applied for a pardon. CZ, as he’s known, pleaded guilty in 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program. Critics say the relationship poses a conflict of interest for President Trump. Trump, who once called Bitcoin a “scam,” had a change of heart last year, saying he hoped to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Now, crypto ventures have added at least $620 million to his fortune in a span of months, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. For more, Bloomberg News Investigations Reporter, Zeke Faux, joined Businessweek Daily. (Source: Bloomberg)
