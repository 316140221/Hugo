Elon Musk warned of difficult times ahead for Tesla after one of the automaker’s worst quarters in over a decade. Tesla will be in a transition period for the next year or more, losing electric vehicle incentives in the US and needing time to roll out autonomous vehicles, the chief executive officer said. In geopolitics, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that the bloc’s ties with his country “have reached an inflection point,” illustrating what’s at stake in their summit shadowed by tensions spanning trade to the war in Ukraine. Today's guests: Nataliia Lipikhina, JPMorgan Private Bank EMEA Equity Strategy Head, Sören Radde, Point72 European Economic Research Head, Fenella McGerty, International Institute for Strategic Studies Senior Fellow for Defence Economics (Source: Bloomberg)
