Via Transportation has entered a strategic partnership with Waymo to launch autonomous rides for public transit, starting in Chandler, Arizona this fall. Operating hours and pricing of a Waymo ride will be the same as human-driven rides under the city of Chandler's on-demand, paid transportation program, which charges $2 for a single ride. Daniel Ramot, co-founder and CEO of Via, joins Caroline Hyde on “Bloomberg Tech.” (Source: Bloomberg)
