Meta Platforms Inc. topped projections for second-quarter sales and gave a stronger-than-expected forecast for the current period, a sign that the social media company’s advertising business is still growing quickly enough to support aggressive spending on artificial intelligence. Meta lifted the low end of its forecast for 2025 capital expenditures as it continues to invest heavily in the talent, infrastructure, data centers and energy needed to compete in a fast-moving AI race. The company now expects to spend $66 billion to $72 billion this year. The projection was adjusted higher in April to account for ongoing trade disputes and AI investments. Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow and Kurt Wagner join Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)
