The UN is preparing emergency measures to slash global peacekeeping operations if funding from the US doesn’t come through, Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. President Donald Trump moved last month to slash more than $800 million from congressional funding designated for peacekeeping in 2024 and 2025. Peacekeepers “are often in places with no peace to keep, with terrorist groups,” Guterres told Bloomberg Television’s David Gura. They spoke in New York ahead of the UN General Assembly meeting next week. (Source: Bloomberg)
