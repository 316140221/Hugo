Oil jumped after an Israeli attack in Qatar escalated the conflict in the Middle East, the source of about a third of the world’s supplies, increasing the geopolitical risk premium for crude. West Texas Intermediate climbed as much as 2.3% to top $63 a barrel after the Israel Defense Forces conducted a strike in Doha targeting the senior leadership of Hamas, which has been declared a terrorist group by the US and Europe. Several blasts were heard in the city, according to media reports, and Qatar said the attack violated international law. Bloomberg's Mike McGlone reports. (Source: Bloomberg)
