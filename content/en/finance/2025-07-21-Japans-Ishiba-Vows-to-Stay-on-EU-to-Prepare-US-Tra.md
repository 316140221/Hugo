Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he intended to stay on even as his ruling coalition suffered a historic setback in an upper house election on Sunday, an outcome that may further unsettle markets. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party along with longtime partner Komeito lost its majority in the chamber, public broadcaster NHK reported, saying the bloc failed to win the 50 seats it needed to maintain control. That marks the first time since 1955 that a leader from the storied Japanese party will govern the country without a majority in at least one of the legislative bodies. Today's guests: Aneka Beneby, Julius Baer Portfolio Manager, Phoenix Kalen, Société Générale Corporate & Investment Banking Head of Emerging Markets Research, Philippe Chryssicopoulos, UBS Global Co-Head of the Global Industrials Group & Global Head of Infrastructure and Power.
