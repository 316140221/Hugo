Union Pacific agreed to acquire Norfolk Southern in a cash-and-stock transaction valuing the company at about $72 billion, forming a transcontinental rail behemoth in what stands to be the industry’s largest deal ever. Norfolk Southern shareholders will receive one Union Pacific share and $88.82 in cash for each Norfolk share, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. Union Pacific will issue about 225 million shares to Norfolk Southern investors, representing 27% ownership in the combined company. The deal, which they aim to close by early 2027, implies a value of $320 a share for Norfolk. That would represent a roughly 23% premium to Norfolk Southern’s stock before the first reports of a potential deal this month. The tie-up is poised to transform the North American rail market. Tony Hatch, Founder of ABH Consulting, speaks on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney. (Source: Bloomberg)
