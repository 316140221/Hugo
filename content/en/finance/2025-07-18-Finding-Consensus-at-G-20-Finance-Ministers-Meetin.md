As some of the world’s most powerful finance ministers meet at a beach-side resort in South Africa, this year’s Group of 20 host is trying to keep its agenda on course. A global trade war, initiated by US President Donald Trump, and the acrimony it has wrought between major economies means that the group is struggling to keep its focus on South Africa’s stated aims, which include debt relief, sustainable finance and reforms to the world’s development-finance institutions. Sanusha Naidu, Institute for Global Dialogue Senior Research Fellow says the key question is around finding consensus on a communique to be taken to the G-20 Leaders' Summit later this year. On tariffs, Naidu said the "unpredictable" nature of Trump's presidency means the outcome for South Africa remains unclear. Naidu joined Tom Mackenzie on 'Bloomberg: The Pulse'. (Source: Bloomberg)
