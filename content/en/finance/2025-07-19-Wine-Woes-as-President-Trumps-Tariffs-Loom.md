A planned 30% US tariff on EU wines could hike prices, slash choice, and force layoffs across America’s wine trade. The US wine industry warns that distributors who rely on European bottles for most of their revenue would collapse, hurting domestic winemakers and vintners too. While some California grape growers hope the tariffs will level the playing field for US winemakers, importers and retailers are skeptical that protectionism is the long-term solution. Critics say tariffs won’t fix oversupply or falling demand and would instead shrink the entire U.S. wine ecosystem. (Source: Bloomberg)
