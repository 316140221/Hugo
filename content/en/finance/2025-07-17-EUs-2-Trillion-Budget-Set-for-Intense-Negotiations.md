Roxana Minzatu, the European Commission's executive vice president for social rights and skills, discusses the EU's proposal of a budget of close to €2 trillion ($2.3 trillion) for the 2028-2034 cycle. The plan is intended to address a range of challenges from rising global economic competition to increased defense demands. The figure is a substantial jump from the €1.2 trillion that was allocated to the budget during the last budgetary cycle, between 2021 and 2027. Minzatu speaks on Bloomberg Television from Brussels.
