The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will air its last episode in May of next year, marking the end of the franchise, Paramount Global’s CBS network said. Colbert, who has hosted the program for a decade, announced the show’s end during a taping on Thursday. He said he learned about the network’s decision the day before. Colbert replaced comedian David Letterman, who created and hosted the program for 22 years. “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” CBS executives said in a joint statement. “It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” Audience members at the Thursday taping booed at the news of the show’s demise. “I’m not getting replaced,” Colbert said in an Instagram clip of his announcement, where he thanked all his supporters. “This is all just going away.” Bloomberg News Media and Entertainment Editor Felix Gillette reports.
