Apple Inc. reported third-quarter revenue that handily topped analysts’ estimates, boosted by surprisingly strong sales of the iPhone and products in China. Revenue rose 9.6% to $94 billion in the period, which ended June 28, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated $89.3 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple had projected a $900 million headwind from tariffs during the period, saying that revenue would grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Though US tariffs are still expected to weigh on results in the long run, they likely provided a boon to Apple in the latest period &mdash; with consumers rushing to stores to get out ahead of expected price increases. The company also has been staging a comeback in China, a market where local phone brands have made inroads with consumers. Bloomberg's Sarah Frier and Tigress Financial Partners CIO Ivan Feinseth join Bloomberg Businesswek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)
