US-China tensions and regional security concerns loom over Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Darren Lim of the Australian National University says Albanese is keeping focus on his economic agenda, as China remains Australia’s biggest export market. Lim talks about how Canberra walks a fine line between its biggest trading partner and its most important long-term security ally on "Bloomberg: The Asia Trade." (Source: Bloomberg)
