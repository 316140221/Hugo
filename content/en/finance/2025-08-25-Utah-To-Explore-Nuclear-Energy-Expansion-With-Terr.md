Utah Governor Spencer Cox and Chris Levesque, president and CEO of TerraPower said cooperation between the state and the nuclear energy industry is an essential to meet growing power demands. This landmark agreement establishes a non-binding framework for cooperation among the three parties and supports Gov. Cox’s Operation Gigawatt, a strategic effort to build an energy ecosystem that serves Utah and the Western U.S. Under the agreement, OED, TerraPower, and Flagship will jointly identify and assess sites for a potential advanced nuclear plant, with the goal of establishing preliminary site recommendations by the end of 2025. Site selection will be based on an evaluation of a variety of factors including community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability of the site to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and access to existing infrastructure.
