President Trump said “inflation is down to a perfect, beautiful number" in the oval office this afternoon. The comments come as US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years, suggesting companies are passing along higher import costs related to tariffs. Betsey Stevenson, Professor of Public Policy and Economics at the University of Michigan reacted to the comments on Bloomberg's Balance of Power and said tariffs are contributing to inflation. She also said, she does not see the reason behind President Trump's push for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates. (Source: Bloomberg)
