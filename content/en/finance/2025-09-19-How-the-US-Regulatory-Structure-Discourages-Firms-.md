As more money is invested into the US stock market, and indexes hit record levels, a contradictory force is playing out as well: fewer companies are choosing to go public. Bryce Tingle, the N. Murray Edwards Chair in Business Law at the University of Calgary, details the forces behind this trend, and the perils that come with a wide swath of investors increasingly relying on the same group of select firms to perform well. Professor Tingle discusses what he sees as declining innovation and rising economic concentration with Carol Massar, Tim Stenovec and Bloomberg Intelligence Global Equity Strategist Gillian Wolff on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.
