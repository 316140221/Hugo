General Motors Co. has signed a deal with Texas-based Noveon Magnetics Inc. to secure rare-earth magnets for its full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, marking the third domestic supply contract the automaker has signed related to the critical trade dominated by China. The latest agreement and two others &mdash; with Las Vegas-based MP Materials Corp. and E-Vac Magnetics, a South Carolina-based unit of Germany’s Vacuumschmelze GmbH &mdash; will allow GM to get the majority of rare-earth magnets it sources directly from domestic suppliers, the Detroit carmaker said Wednesday. Dr Gracelin Baskaran, Director, Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the United States is giving all the right signals. (Source: Bloomberg)
