The US Federal Reserve releases video of its renovations that are underway and over budget. Costs have ballooned to $2.5 billion. Work is being done on the headquarters building and a building at 1951 Constitution Avenue. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has defended the renovation work as transparent. President Donald Trump, who says Powell needs to lower interest rates, says the project is being mismanaged. This is video released by the Federal Reserve on July 21. (Source: Bloomberg)
