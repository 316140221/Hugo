Mercury 13, co-founded by Victoire Cogevina Reynal, has acquired a majority stake in Bristol City Women's Football Club. Following the announcement, Victoire says: "We are very focused on making sure that there's a path to financial sustainability, to ensure that these clubs don't depend on a men's team." Speaking on Bloomberg TV's Opening Trade program, she continues: "That happens through commercial growth. We want to attract more sponsors, we want to grow audiences, we want to fill stadiums and that's our plan for Bristol." (Source: Bloomberg)
