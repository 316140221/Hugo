He says it's become more politicized. “The biggest risk in this situation is being that we lose contact with our 2% inflation target and become a country with an inflation psychology,” said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV. He speaks on Bloomberg's "Wall Street Week." (Source: Bloomberg)
