Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook signaled her intention to remain at the central bank, despite calls for her resignation by President Donald Trump over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook said she will gather accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts, and that she has no intention of being bullied to step down from her position. Senator Elizabeth Warren said the Trump administration "should not weaponize the federal government to illegally fire independent Fed Board members", according to her emailed statement. Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance said negotiations over ending Russia's war in Ukraine are focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and territory Russia wants to control.
