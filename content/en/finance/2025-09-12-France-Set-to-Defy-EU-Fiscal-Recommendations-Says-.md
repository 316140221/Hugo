Silvia Ardagna, Head of European Economics Research at Barclays, says that while the Christine Lagarde’s “standard answer” has been for countries to stick with the European Commission’s fiscal consolidation recommendations, “the reality is that we expect France to do exactly the opposite”. Ardagna adds on Bloomberg TV's The Opening Trade there will be a trade-off between political stability and fiscal consolidation, with the French government likely to “stay in place but watering down what was the proposal of the former PM.” This interview occurred Thursday, September 11.
