The US Department of Energy intends to offer funding opportunities totaling nearly $1 billion “to advance and scale mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies across key stages of the critical minerals and materials supply chains,” it says in a statement. The funding would accelerate the US critical minerals and materials sector and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, according to officials. Factorial CEO Siyu Huang joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss rare earth mineral supply chains, the company's Mercedes partnership, solid state battery manufacturing, and more.
