Microsoft Corp. reported better-than-expected growth in its cloud business, which it says brought in more than $75 billion in the past year, as the company continues to commercialize artificial intelligence services. The closely watched Azure cloud-computing unit posted a 39% rise in sales during Microsoft’s fiscal fourth quarter, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Analysts projected 34% revenue growth. The company said sales at the cloud division grew 34% to more than $75 billion during the year ended in June, the first time the company has disclosed a revenue figure for Azure, which sells computing power and other services to businesses. Overall, sales rose 18% to $76.4 billion during the quarter. Net income was $3.65 a share. Greg Halter, director of research at Carnegie Investment Counsel, and Bloomberg Intelligence's Anurag Rana react to the earnings. (Source: Bloomberg)
