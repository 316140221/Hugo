Apple's next-generation Studio Display will contain an "A19 Pro" chip, according to code reviewed by MacRumors. Yesterday, signs of the second-generation Studio Display with the codename J427 were spotted in Apple code. Now, it has emerged that the device will contain the as-yet unreleased A19 Pro chip. The A19 Pro is almost certain to debut in the iPhone 17 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max next month. The Studio Display's chip supports features like Center Stage, Spatial Audio, and "Hey Siri" commands. The current Studio Display launched in 2022 with the A13 Bionic, a chip that started out in the iPhone 11 lineup back in 2019. Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, when we're also expecting new Macs. Little is known about the new Studio Display, but it could feature mini-LED backlighting for improved brightness, contrast, and color.Related Roundups: Apple Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio DisplayRelated Forum: Mac AccessoriesThis article, ...
