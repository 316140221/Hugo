Apple seeded the fifth developer beta of iOS 26 today, and while the number of significant changes has dropped, there are quite a few smaller tweaks. Apple is continuing to refine button placement, animations, and design in preparation for launching &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; in September. Camera Apple added a toggle in the Camera app to allow users to toggle on Classic Mode, a setting that reverses the scroll direction when you swap from mode to mode. Mail There is now a dedicated Select button in the Mail app, instead of the button being tucked away inside of the "..." menu. AirDrop Icon There is a new AirDrop icon in the Share Sheet. Lock Screen There is an animation when entering your passcode on the Lock Screen, with the numbers jumping in to place. There's also a new animation when locking the iPhone when playing music.
