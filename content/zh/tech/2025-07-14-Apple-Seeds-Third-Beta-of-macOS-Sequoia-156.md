Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming macOS Sequoia 15.6 update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the second &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.6 beta. Developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An Apple ID associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta. There's no word yet on what's included in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.6, and no new features were discovered in the first two betas. Apple's work on &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is winding down as it focuses on macOS Tahoe, the newest version of macOS that's coming in the fall.Related Roundup: macOS SequoiaRelated Forum: macOS SequoiaThis article, &quot;Apple Seeds Third Beta of macOS Sequoia 15.6&quot; first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums
