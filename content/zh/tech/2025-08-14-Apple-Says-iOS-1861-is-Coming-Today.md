In case you missed it — this is the post for people who mainly only read headlines — Apple has announced that it will be releasing iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 later today. Apple shared this information in a press release on its Newsroom website. The software updates will re-enable the Blood Oxygen feature on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States. It is unclear if iOS 18.6.1 will include anything else, such as bug fixes or security patches. Overall, it is likely to be a minor update. Apple is now focused on iOS 26, which is deep into beta testing ahead of a general release in September.Related Roundups: iOS 18, iPadOS 18Related Forums: iOS 18, iPadOS 18This article, &quot;Apple Says iOS 18.6.1 is Coming Today&quot; first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums
