The new iPhone Air is limited to USB 2 transfer speeds and it does not support faster USB 3 transfer speeds like the iPhone 17 Pro models. Apple also didn't update the USB port that it's using for the iPhone 17, so USB 3 continues to be a Pro-only feature. With USB 2 support, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air and the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; support transfer speeds of up to 480Mb/s. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max support transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s, like the iPhone 16 Pro models. 480Mb/s is the same transfer speed that Lightning offered, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models are still limited to the speeds of the now-outdated Lightning technology. Apple did not make any changes to USB-C transfer speeds this year, and it is a bit of a disappointment to see the &#36;999 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air limited to USB 2.
