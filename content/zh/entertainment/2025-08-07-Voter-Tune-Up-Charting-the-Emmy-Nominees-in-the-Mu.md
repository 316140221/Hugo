This year&#8217;s Emmy music races are chock-full of first-timers, surprising choices and maddening statistics. For example: Thomas and Julia Newman, who scored &#8220;Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,&#8221; are father and daughter, an Emmy first for a composing duo. Mick Giacchino, nominated for &#8220;The Penguin,&#8221; is the son of Emmy-winning &#8220;Lost&#8221; composer Michael Giacchino. [&#8230;]
