Switzerland's president is about to leave Washington without reaching a deal to get President Donald Trump to lower the 39% tariff he put on the country. A delegation led by Karin Keller-Sutter presented a new proposal to US officials, but no agreement was reached, according to people familiar with the situation. Keller-Sutter never met with Trump himself. Bloomberg's Tyler Kendall reports from the White House. (Source: Bloomberg)
