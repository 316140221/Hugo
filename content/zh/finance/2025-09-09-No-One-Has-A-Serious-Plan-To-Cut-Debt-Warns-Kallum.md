A measure of France's borrowing costs exceeded Italy's for the first time in the euro zone's history, demonstrating how investor concerns over fiscal policy are redrawing the region's bond markets. The shift on Tuesday was due to technical reasons, as the underlying bond used for benchmark French 10-year yields moved to a slighter later maturity than the Italian equivalent. But the trend toward convergence between the two nations' debt has been years in the making. For market veterans, it's a remarkable development. Kallum Pickering Chief Economist at Peel Hunt tells Bloomberg radio's Caroline Hepker and Valerie Tytel that there's a wider issue of debt burdens in large economies, and the UK is more vulnerable than many other nations.
