President Donald Trump has extended a pause on tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days. John Gong, professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, says truce extensions will likely be the new normal, as Trump will continue to use tariffs as a bargaining chip with China. He also says Trump's tactic is to respect stronger countries and bully weaker ones in tariff negotiations. He speaks with David Ingles and Yvonne Man on "Bloomberg: The China Show".
