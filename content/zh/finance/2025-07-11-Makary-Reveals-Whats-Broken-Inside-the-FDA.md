After 100 days as FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary lays out his vision for reform, starting with the broken systems he’s uncovered inside the agency. He confronts the FDA’s failure in the opioid crisis, acknowledges the loss of public trust during COVID, and calls out regulatory capture and internal conflicts of interest, including practices that allowed FDA staff to block their own drug safety reviews. Makary announces a new policy to publish drug rejection letters and introduces a priority review voucher program to fast-track approvals for companies that align with U.S. public health goals, including lowering drug prices to match those in other wealthy nations. “This president,” he says, “does not like to see Americans getting ripped off.” He also pledges to modernize food chemical oversight, reform the outdated GRAS system, and cut bureaucratic bloat to refocus the FDA on science, safety, and common sense.
