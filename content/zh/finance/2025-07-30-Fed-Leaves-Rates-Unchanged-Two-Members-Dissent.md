Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged but downgraded their view of the US economy, a sign policymakers could be edging closer to lowering borrowing costs. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-2 on Wednesday to hold the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 4.25%-4.5%, as they have at each of their meetings this year. Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted against the decision in favor of a quarter-point cut. Bloomberg's Michael McKee reports. (Source: Bloomberg)
