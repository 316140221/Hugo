Nvidia Corp. agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel Corp. and said the two will co-develop chips for PCs and data centers. Intel will use Nvidia’s graphics technology in upcoming personal computer chips and also provide its processors for data center products built around Nvidia hardware. While Intel has some catching up to do when it comes to AI, says The Fletcher School at Tufts University professor Chris Miller, it has unique know-how when it comes to building processor chips which servers require. On the chip design side, Miller believes, there are varying levels of expertise that the two companies can bring together. He joined Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.'
