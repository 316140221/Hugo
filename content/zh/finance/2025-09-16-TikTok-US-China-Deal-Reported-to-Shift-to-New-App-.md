The WSJ reported that a new arrangement agreed to by US and China government negotiators would require a new social media app with an American-dominated board. TikTok's US Business would be controlled by an investor consortium including Oracle, a long time TikTok partner. The Wall Street Journal reports both sides are working out final details and the terms could change. Bloomberg Businessweek's Editor Brad Stone says the deal would be a win for TikTok's competitors.
