US equity futures rise as the payrolls report will set the stage for the Fed to proceed cutting interest rates. President Trump said he would be imposing "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports “very shortly,” but not to companies that have pledged to boost US investments. Broadcom is helping OpenAI design and produce AI chips from 2026. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse discusses the impact and the uncertainties around the EU-US tariff agreement with Bloomberg's Oliver Crook. “Bloomberg Brief” delivers the market news, data and analysis you need to set your agenda.
