Nvidia has instructed component suppliers to stop production related to the H20, The Information reported, following news Beijing urged local companies to avoid using the AI chip designed specifically for the Chinese market. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, meanwhile, told reporters in Taiwan that the company assured there were no "security backdoors" on those chips, after China voiced concerns. Ed Yardeni, president at Yardeni Research, explains what it could mean for the AI race and tech stocks. He speaks on Bloomberg Insight. (Source: Bloomberg)
