Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has reiterated his support for a two-state solution in a rare phone call with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Tens of thousands of people joined a march across Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge over the weekend, as pressure mounts for Albanese to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly. Australian National University Professor Donald Rothwell says the time has come for Canberra to do more than just issue statements. (Source: Bloomberg)
