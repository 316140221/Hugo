Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities said President Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin will have more than Ukraine to talk about as the US and Russia are at odds over a number of issues. US President Donald Trump warned he would impose “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin didn’t agree to a ceasefire agreement later this week, following a call with European leaders ahead of his meeting with the Russian president. Trump also said he hoped to use the Friday meeting to set up a “quick second meeting” with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy after allies pressed him to push for such a summit.
