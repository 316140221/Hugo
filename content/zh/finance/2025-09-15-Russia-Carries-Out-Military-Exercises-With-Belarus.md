Russia holds joint military exercises with Belarus forces near Minsk. International media were invited to watch demonstrations of live fire and air strikes, mobile fire groups on motorcycles and buggies, and air defense support. The drills are meant to show close defense ties between Moscow and Minsk. Belarus borders Ukraine and four NATO nations. The maneuvers follow the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace which triggered fears of a wider conflict. (Source: Bloomberg)
