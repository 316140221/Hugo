Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a controversial vote on new congressional maps. “Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans,” Abbott said in a statement Monday. “I ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans.” The governor’s move escalates a standoff with Democrats with two weeks left in the state legislature’s special session, which was also set to address other issues from a cannabis ban to last month’s deadly floods in central Texas. Republican lawmakers proposed a redistricting plan last week that Democrats describe as a gerrymander designed to give more seats in the US Congress to the GOP. (Source: Bloomberg)
