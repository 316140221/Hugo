Venus Williams returned to professional tennis due to insurance reasons, citing her need to pay for COBRA, a federal law that allows individuals to temporarily continue their employer-sponsored health insurance. The US system of health insurance is built on employer-sponsored coverage, which has "scant labor market or health justification" and is driven by "entrenched interests" rather than producing good health outcomes. Bloomberg's Kathryn Anne Edwards has more on the story. (Source: Bloomberg)
