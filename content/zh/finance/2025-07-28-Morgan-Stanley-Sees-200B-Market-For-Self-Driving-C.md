Morgan Stanley analysts forecast that the market for self-driving vehicles will hit $200 billion by 2030. Analysts Adam Jonas and Tim Hsiao say sales of autonomous cars with Level 2 and above autonomy will jump to 28% of unit sales by 2030 from 8% in 2024. But the analysts warn of China's advantage, writing: "An outsized EV user base and tech deflation have given China an early edge, but dominance of AI computing power and data are advantages that Silicon Valley firms and Germany’s Big Three can use to boost their positions." Bloomberg News Auto Reporter Keith Naughton joins Bloomberg Businessweek to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)
