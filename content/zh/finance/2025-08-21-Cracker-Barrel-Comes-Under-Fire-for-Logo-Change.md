Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store fell as much as 15% on Thursday after the restaurant chain came out with a new logo. The company removed the image of an old man leaning against a barrel from its logo, leaving just the words Cracker Barrel. Conservative backlash to the change followed on social media. Some compared this protest to the same kind Bud Light faced when it collaborated with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. More details from "Bloomberg The Close." (Source: Bloomberg)
