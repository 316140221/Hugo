Ethan Klingsberg, Partner and Co-Head of U.S. Corporate and M&amp;A at Freshfields, says he’s seeing a strong fourth quarter driven by data center and energy buildouts, which are boosting projections for the next three years. He tells Katie Greifeld and Eric Balchunas on “The Close” that after three to five years, growth may flatten or decline once those projects are complete. (Source: Bloomberg)
