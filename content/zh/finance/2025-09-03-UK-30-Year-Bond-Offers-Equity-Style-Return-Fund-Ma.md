Eric Lonergan, discretionary macro head at Calibrate Partners, says the global selloff in bonds could offer investors the opportunity to "make a lot of money." Speaking on Bloomberg Television, Lonergan says, "if you take a 30-year gilt yielding -- where are we at 5.6%, 5.7%, 5.8% -- if you think the Bank of England is going to deliver you 2% inflation over the medium term, that is an equity-style return now for owning a gilt."
