President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal between the US and the European Union on Sunday at Trump's golf club in Turnberry, Scotland, although they didn’t disclose the full details of the pact or release any written materials. The 15% rates will take effect Aug. 1, according to a US official. Von der Leyen and Trump also differed on some of the key terms of the deal they announced. The US president said the tariff level would apply to “automobiles and everything else,” but not pharmaceuticals and metals. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson, Kriti Gupta and Valerie Tytel.
