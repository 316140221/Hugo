President Donald Trump's political momentum within his party shows no signs of slowing. The president has a 93% approval rating among Republican voters. His emergency tariff powers, campaign against the Federal Reserve and deployment of the military within the US are some of the ways in which he's been stretching his executive power. Actum Partner Morris Reid says Trump "continues to be underestimated" by the Democratic Party, world leaders and business leaders. Reid adds Trump is "focused, has a plan" and says his staff are "executing at precision pace". But Reid says Trump is in store for an October "surprise". Reid predicts a double blow in the form of a government shutdown and the Supreme Court upholding a ruling against Trump's tariffs. Reid appeared on The Pulse with Francine Lacqua.
