Former UK Ambassador to the US Peter Westmacott said Trump's promises of security guarantees for Ukraine provide a credible alternative to enlarging NATO, something that Russia opposes. Donald Trump urged Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy to show some “flexibility” as the US president accelerates his efforts to end the war in Ukraine and encourages the two leaders to hold a bilateral summit. “I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he’s not, it’s going to be a rough situation,” Trump said Tuesday in an interview on Fox News. “I hope that Zelenskiy, President Zelenskiy, will do what he has to do. He has to show some flexibility also.” (Source: Bloomberg)
