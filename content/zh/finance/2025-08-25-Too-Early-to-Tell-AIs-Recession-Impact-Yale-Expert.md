Natasha Sarin, president and co-founder of The Yale Budget Lab, says “it’s too early to tell” if the U.S. would be in recession without AI. She tells Romaine Bostick and Katie Greifeld on “The Close” that the key question is whether AI acts as a complement or substitute. Sarin adds her team has data on how exposed occupations are to AI but lacks the capacity to map that exposure to actual employment figures. (Source: Bloomberg)
