Toril Bosoni, head of oil markets at the International Energy Agency, discusses the outlook for oil supplies, prices and OPEC+ production. A record oil surplus projected for next year is looking even bigger as OPEC+ continues to revive production and the group’s rivals grow, the IEA said in a report, Thursday. World output will exceed consumption by an average of 3.33 million barrels per day in 2026, about 360,000 a day more than anticipated a month ago, according to the report. (Source: Bloomberg)
