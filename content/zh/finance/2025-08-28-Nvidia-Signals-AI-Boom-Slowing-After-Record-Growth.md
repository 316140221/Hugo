Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, gave a tepid revenue forecast for the current period, signaling that growth is decelerating after a staggering two-year boom in artificial intelligence spending. Sales will be roughly $54 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which runs through October, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Though that was in line with the average Wall Street estimate, some analysts had projected more than $60 billion. The outlook adds to concern that the pace of investment in AI systems is unsustainable. Difficulties in China also have clouded Nvidia’s business. Today's guests: John Bilton, JPMorgan Asset Management Head of Global Multi-Asset Strategy, Adrian Cox, Deutsche Bank Research Thematic Strategist, Orysia Lutsevych, Chatham House Deputy Director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme (Source: Bloomberg)
