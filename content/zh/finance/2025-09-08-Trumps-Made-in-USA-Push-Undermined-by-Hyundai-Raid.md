President Donald Trump has built his economic pitch on forcing foreign companies to bring jobs and production to the US. Last week’s shock immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor Co.-LG Energy Solution Ltd. battery venture in Georgia exposes a major contradiction in that strategy. The projects Trump points to as proof of his reshoring success now risk being paralyzed by US enforcement actions that target the very workforce building them, according to industry analysts. Getting the multibillion-dollar plants up and running requires hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign engineers and subcontractors on the ground, yet companies like Hyundai and LG struggle to find easy visa options to bring them in legally and flexibly. Bloomberg's Nick Wadhams reports. (Source: Bloomberg)
