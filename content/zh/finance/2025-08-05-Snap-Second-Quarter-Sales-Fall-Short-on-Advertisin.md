Snap Inc. reported second-quarter sales that were shy of Wall Street’s average estimates as the company, owner of the Snapchat photo-sharing app, dealt with a technical issue with its ad-buying tools that slowed revenue growth. The company’s shares tumbled in late trading. Snap reported sales of $1.345 billion, slightly less than the $1.35 billion analysts were looking for. Revenue was crimped when the company inadvertently shipped an update to its advertising auction that allowed marketers to buy ads at “substantially reduced prices,” Snap said. That issue has been fixed, according to a letter to shareholders Tuesday, and “advertising revenue growth has improved.” Snap’s sales in the current period will likely be higher than analysts projected. Revenue will be $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion, according to the statement Tuesday. Analysts on average had projected sales at the low end of that range. (Source: Bloomberg)
