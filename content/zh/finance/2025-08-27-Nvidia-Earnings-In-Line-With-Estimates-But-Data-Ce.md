Bloomberg's Mandeep Singh, Sarah Frier and Jay Goldberg, senior analyst at Seaport Research Partners, react as Nvidia reports lackluster earnings. The chipmaker's overall revenue came in slightly higher than estimates, but data center revenue was short and the numbers excluded sales in China. Nvidia also reported it approved an additional $60 billion in share buyback. (Source: Bloomberg)
