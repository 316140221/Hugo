Broadcom is helping OpenAI design and produce an artificial intelligence accelerator from 2026, getting into a lucrative sphere dominated by Nvidia. The two firms plan to ship the first chips in that lineup starting next year, a person familiar with the matter said, asking to remain anonymous discussing a private deal. OpenAI will initially use the chip for its own internal purposes, the Financial Times reported earlier. In trade news, China slapped preliminary duties on pork imports from the European Union, a move set to disrupt shipments from one of the world’s biggest suppliers and further stoke trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing. Today's guests: Emmanuel Cau, Barclays Head of European Equity Strategy, Sander Tordoir, Centre for European Reform Chief Economist, Michael Haigh, SGCIB Head of FIC & Commodities Research (Source: Bloomberg)
