Former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren says “it’s a little too soon to call September” as he examines US economic data and discusses the process of considering the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Rosengren also explains why he sees a “consistency problem” with Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump’s nominee for a seat on the Fed’s Board of Governors that expires in January.
