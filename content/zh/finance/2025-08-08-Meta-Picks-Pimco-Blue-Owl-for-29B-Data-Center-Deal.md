Meta Platforms Inc. has selected Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. to lead a $29 billion financing for its data center expansion in rural Louisiana as the race for artificial intelligence infrastructure heats up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Pimco is expected to lead a $26 billion debt portion of the financing, while Blue Owl is providing $3 billion of equity, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, they said. Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of internet research at Evercore ISI says Meta is reaccelerating their revenue growth using AI. (Source: Bloomberg)
