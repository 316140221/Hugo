Apple Inc.’s earnings report is unlikely to give investors the catalyst they’ve been looking for to revive the iPhone maker’s struggling stock price. The technology behemoth is expected to post profit and revenue growth that severely lags the industry when it reports its fiscal third-quarter results Thursday after the market closes. This comes as, Apple lost its fourth AI researcher in a month to Meta Platforms Inc., marking the latest setback to the iPhone maker’s artificial intelligence efforts. Bowen Zhang, a key multimodal AI researcher at Apple, left the company on Friday and is set to join Meta’s recently formed superintelligence team, according to people familiar with the matter. Zhang was part of the Apple foundation models group, or AFM, which built the core technology behind the company’s AI platform. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman looks ahead to earnings. (Source: Bloomberg)
