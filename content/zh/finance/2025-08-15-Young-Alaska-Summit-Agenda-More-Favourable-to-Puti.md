Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to strengthen his rapport with Donald Trump ahead of their summit, praising the US leader’s efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine and dangling the promise of economic cooperation as well as a new arms control treaty. President Trump meanwhile is downplaying the likely outcomes from the talks, saying a follow-up involving Ukraine's leader will be more important as he seeks an end to the war. Karen E. Young, Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy told Bloomberg’s Chief Africa Correspondent Jennifer Zabasajja on Horizons Middle East and Africa how this summit will be perceived in both the US & Europe.
