Robert McWhirter, a civil rights lawyer and constitutional law expert, said President Trump has some authority over the National Guard in the nation’s capital but a decision to send them into other cities could end up in court. President Donald Trump has called Chicago “a mess” and threatened to tap the National Guard to tackle crime in the third-largest US city, expanding federal deployments beyond Washington, DC. His comments, though, come just as Chicago is on the rebound. Murders fell to the lowest in more than a decade, traffic at the city’s main airport hit a record in June and investment is coming back &mdash; a billionaire soccer team owner is building a $650-million stadium and a tech startup is pouring $1 billion into quantum computing in the South Side.
