Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Alberto Musalem said, “the current modestly restrictive setting of the policy rate is consistent with today’s full employment labor market and core inflation” in comments on Wednesday during an event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Musalem also stressed the importance of taking a “balanced approach” to policy right now and not weight it too much to support the labor market or to fight inflation.
