The leaders of OpenAI and Nvidia plan to pledge support for billions of dollars in UK data center investments when they head to the country next week at the same time as President Donald Trump, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The two companies are teaming up with London-based data center business Nscale Global Holdings on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are part of a delegation of US executives expected to visit the country.
